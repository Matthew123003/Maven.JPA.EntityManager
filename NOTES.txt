SPRINGBOOT JPA PERSISTENCE NOTES

https://www.codejava.net/frameworks/spring-boot/spring-data-jpa-entitymanager-examples

This code represents a typical Spring Boot application with JPA (Java Persistence API) integration.

@SpringBootApplication: This annotation marks the class as a Spring Boot application class. It
 enables auto-configuration and component scanning. It combines @Configuration,
 @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan annotations into a single annotation.
public static void main(String[] args): This is the entry point of the application.
It creates an instance of the SpringApplication class and starts the Spring application.
 The SpringApplication.run() method takes two arguments: the main class (PersistMain.class)
  and the command-line arguments (args).
@Bean: This annotation is used to declare a bean in the Spring application context. In this
 case, it declares a bean of type CommandLineRunner. CommandLineRunner is a functional
 interface provided by Spring Boot, which allows you to execute code after the Spring
 application context has been loaded and just before the application starts running.
runner(ArtistRepo repo): This method defines the implementation of the CommandLineRunner
interface. It receives an instance of ArtistRepo (presumably a repository interface for
managing Artist entities) as a parameter. The method body contains the code that will be
executed when the application starts.
List<Artist> allArtists = (List<Artist>) repo.findAll();: This line retrieves all Artist
entities from the database using the findAll() method provided by the ArtistRepo interface.
 This assumes that ArtistRepo extends Spring Data JPA's CrudRepository, which provides various
  methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
for (Artist artist : allArtists) { System.out.println(artist.getName()); }: This loop iterates
 over the list of Artist entities retrieved from the database and prints the name of each artist
  to the console. It demonstrates how to access and process data retrieved from the database
  using Spring Data JPA.
Overall, this code sets up a Spring Boot application, retrieves data from the database using
Spring Data JPA, and prints it to the console. The CommandLineRunner bean ensures that the code
 inside its run() method is executed when the Spring application starts up.
